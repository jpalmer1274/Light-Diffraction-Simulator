Theory:

For a circular aperture, interference occurs between all rays from the
whole area producing a series of concentric fringes. The exact solution in this case is difficult but
turns out to be of the same form as for a slit (d ‚àô sin Œ∏ = ùëö Œª) except that m is non-integer (i.e. m =
1.22, 2.23, 3.24, 4.24, 5.24. . .) and d is the diameter of the hole.

The diffraction grating is an optical component used to spatially separate
polychromatic light (white light) into its constituent optical frequencies. Diffraction gratings are used
in such diverse fields as spectroscopy, colorimetry, metrology and laser optics.
A large number of parallel, closely spaced slits constitutes a diffraction grating, characterized by the
spacing d. G = 1/d is the slit frequency or slit density, more commonly called "lines per millimeter".
The condition for maximum intensity is known as the grating equation, same as [1]:
d ‚àô sin Œ∏ = ùëöŒª, ùëö = 1, 2, 3 ‚Ä¶
However, angular separation of the maxima is generally much greater because the slit spacing is so
small for a diffraction grating. The intensity maximum is very sharp and narrow, providing the high
resolution for spectroscopic applications. The peak intensities are also much higher for the grating
than for the double slit
